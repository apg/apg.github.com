code navigation.</p>

<p>when is a simple unix shell utility which allows you to run a command repeatedly until
it succeeds (with some flexibility on what that means) and then run another. The flexibility
comes in in that the command not dying for N seconds can be the success signal, instead
of the returned status code.</p>

<p>Phizer is a dynamic image resizing proxy that can talk to a number of image servers. Phizer can do caching of the remote fetched images, as well as the processed images. Put a CDN in front of this, and you've got yourself a pretty nice prescription for resizing.</p>

<p>Softserv is a simple server construction kit for <a href="http://clojure.org">Clojure</a> which uses a multi-method like mechanism for dispatching on "events" in network protocols. As a proof of concept it worked out OK, but I didn't really push hard on it to gain adoption.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/apg/bitdb">bitdb</a></strong> [python] [bitly] November 2010</p>
<p>bitdb is a hack that turns <a href="http://bitly.com">Bitly</a> into a generic key-value store.
