<p>Moka is an Emacs minor mode for editing Java. It attempts to be very minimalist,
integrates with YASsnippet for cracking down on boilerplate and uses ETAGS for
code navigation.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/apg/keyfavors">keyfavors</a></strong> [gpg] [privacy] [shell] February 2014</p>
<p>Keyfavors is a simple script which makes it easy for attendees of a

file which includes the key id, fingerprint, name, email address and keyfavors
takes the user interactively through all of them.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/apg/when">when</a></strong> [shell] [c] December 2013</p>
<p>when is a simple unix shell utility which allows you to run a command repeatedly until
it succeeds (with some flexibility on what that means) and then run another. The flexibility
comes in in that the command not dying for N seconds can be the success signal, instead
of the returned status code.</p>

<p>Phizer is a dynamic image resizing proxy that can talk to a number of image servers. Phizer can do caching of the remote fetched images, as well as the processed images. Put a CDN in front of this, and you've got yourself a pretty nice prescription for resizing.</p>

<p>QuickPass is a set of 2 shell scripts that I've been using for quite a few years to keep my passwords safe. It makes use of GPG's symmetric encryption to store, well, passwords, and provides a simple way to look them up--the passlook command.</p>

<p>Softserv is a simple server construction kit for <a href="http://clojure.org">Clojure</a> which uses a multi-method like mechanism for dispatching on "events" in network protocols. As a proof of concept it worked out OK, but I didn't really push hard on it to gain adoption.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/apg/bitdb">bitdb</a></strong> [python] [bitly] November 2010</p>
<p>bitdb is a hack that turns <a href="http://bitly.com">Bitly</a> into a generic key-value store. To exercise it, I wrote a <a href="https://github.com/apg/bitdb/blob/master/examples/todo.py">TODO</a> list supporting full history (essentially a simplified version of git). This won an honorable mention in a Bitly API contest.</p>
